## Text Editor in C++

An FLTK-based text editor refers to a text editor that is built using the FLTK (pronounced fulltick) library. FLTK stands for the Fast, Light Toolkit, and it is a cross-platform C++ GUI (Graphical User Interface) development toolkit for creating applications with graphical user interfaces. FLTK is known for its simplicity and speed, making it a popular choice for creating lightweight graphical applications.

When someone mentions an "FLTK-based text editor," they are likely referring to a text editor application that uses the FLTK library for its user interface components, such as buttons, menus, and windows. FLTK can be used to create graphical interfaces for various applications, and a text editor is just one example of what can be built using this toolkit.
